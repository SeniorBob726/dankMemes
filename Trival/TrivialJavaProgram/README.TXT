PROJECT TITLE:  Trivial Program

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  To provide an initial example of the simplest
possible program in Java, and then to modify it to learn some BlueJ
basics.  The instructions for Lab 1, using this project, can be found
at:
    http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs110/LabsEtc/BlueJLab/

VERSION or DATE:  23 March 2008

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  Within BlueJ, compile the project, if
necessary (see next paragraph).  Then right-click (or control-click)
on the TrivialProgramClass.  Select "void main(String[] args)", then
click on "Ok".

If a Java class needs to be compiled, BlueJ indicates this by
painting stripes across the class's icon.  You can compile a single class
from its editor window by clicking on the Compile button at the top of that
window.  Alternatively, you can compile all classes in the project by
clicking on the Compile button in the toolbar to the left of the central
icon diagram for the project.  (Actually, BlueJ will check which classes
need to be compiled and compile only those.)

AUTHORS: Adrian Heldt 

USER INSTRUCTIONS:  This application does nothing, so there is nothing
for the user to do other than to compile and start the project, as described
above.
